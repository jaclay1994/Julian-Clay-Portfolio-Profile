            <p>
              Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio website. I'm in the process learning
              how to code. I believe in freedom in all areas of life, along with
              maining a balanced lifestyle to contain that freedom. My dream is to one
              day be able to live abroad and pursue my dream routine of being able to write,
              meditate, produce music, and surround myself with nature everyday! Having to
              get up at a specified time everyday, being locked into one location and
              operating around in an environment where I'm not growing is a result of
              my career choice as storekeeper at Georgia Power. I am very grateful for
              the opportunity that my company has given me, however the position that I'm
              filling is stopping me from taking for advantage of my time and energy. I would
              love to work at anytime that I designate! If I want to code at 2am to 10am
              I could make that happen or if I wanted to work at home or on the beach, I could
              make that happen. I plan to move to abroad to Puerto Rico and Ghana within the next
              5 years and I will need a way to sustain myself without having to be employed
              by physical location. Coding has also opened up the pathway to helping create
              content for my company called Knowations. Knowtations is an agency that promotes
              thought processing through forms of recording anything within the mental space.
              Collaboration and organization are key components that are worked on through
              various platforms and processes offered to all. Coding in itself is something
              that I enjoy because I love a challenge. From all my years of playing video games,
              coding allows me to re-enter the phase of never giving up in the face of finding
              a solution and having played aroung with emulators, my googling skills finally find
              relevency within my career path.
